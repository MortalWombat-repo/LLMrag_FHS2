**Description:**  
> History, memory and the Nation constituted more than a natural community, a symbiosis  
>  on all levels: scientific and pedagogical, theoretical and practical.  
>  The national definition of the present required justification by illuminating  
>  the past - did we have that in the Republic of Croatia? When is this just starting to occur in  
>  us? The historian has an enormous national responsibility, he is half soldier, half priest. In the 1930s, the State-Nation pair  
>  was progressively replaced by the State-society pair, so history from a tradition of  
>  memory spectacularly became society's knowledge of itself. New,  
>  social history - freed from national identification, has lost  
>  its pedagogical mission of transmitting values, which is clearly demonstrated by the  
>  current educational crisis. The nation is no longer a unifying framework that contains  
>  the consciousness of collectivity. The definition of the nation is no longer a burning issue. With the arrival of  
>  society in the place of the Nation, legitimation by the past gives way to legitimation by  
>  the future.  
>  The nation is no longer a struggle but a given, history has become a social science, and  
>  memory is an exclusively private phenomenon. The historiographical movement is reflexive  
>  the return of history to itself, on the other hand it is a historical movement in law  
>  in the sense of the word that marks the end of a tradition of memory. These two movements,  
>  historical and historiographical, they instruct us to reconsider the basic tools  
>  of historical research and the basic symbols that make up our memory: archives and  
>  tricolor.  
>  Topics that doctoral students choose and critically process through 3 aspects -  
>  historiography, ideology and collective memory.

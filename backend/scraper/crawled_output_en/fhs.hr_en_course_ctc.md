**Description:**  
> This doctoral course in Croatology focuses on the theoretical and methodological study of Croatian traditional culture as a complex system of practices, beliefs, symbolic forms, and everyday life. Special attention is devoted to the relationship between traditional culture and identity, questions of continuity and change, processes of modernization, and the transformation of customary practices in the context of globalization and cultural policies. Through the analysis of selected phenomena (rituals, calendar and life-cycle customs, oral literature, music, dance, traditional crafts, etc.), students acquire contemporary theoretical approaches (ethnological, anthropological, cultural, and croatological) and critical methods of interpretation. The aim of the course is to enable doctoral students to conduct independent scholarly research on Croatian traditional culture within a broader historical, social, and media context, and to develop interdisciplinary interpretations of tradition as a dynamic component of Croatian culture.

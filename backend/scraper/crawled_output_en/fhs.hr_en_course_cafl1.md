**Learning outcomes:**

  2. Distinguish word classes and their morphological, syntactic and lexical features in the Croatian language.
  3. Interpret shorter texts of appropriate topics and vocabulary.
  4. Write simpler texts and letters on familiar topics.
  5. Express their own opinion and plans and describe everyday events by using simple vocabulary.
  6. Establish similarities and differences between the culture of Croatian as a foreign language and the culture of the mother tongue.
  7. Identify and explain basic information about Croatia (flag, coat of arms, anthem, public holidays) and everyday life in Croatia (names, surnames, food, hobbies, housing, public transport).
